I am a Product Manager in the Nuclear Industry, introducing new technology into a highly regulated space. I manage Westinghouse's Fuel Engineering Technology products, which predict and monitor the performance of the nuclear fuel in power plants to ensure safe operation. I have an MS from CMU in Engineering and Technology innovation Management (E&TIM) and a BS from Vanderbilt University in Mechanical Engineering. All thoughts herein are my own.
